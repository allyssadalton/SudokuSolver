**Overview**

The Sudoku Solver is a C++ program that efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking and recursive search. It can take a partially filled Sudoku board as input and output the completed, valid solution.

This project highlights algorithmic problem solving, recursion, and optimization techniques.

**Key Features**

Accepts Sudoku puzzles in a 9Ã—9 grid format

Solves using backtracking (depth-first search)

Validates moves against Sudoku rules (row, column, subgrid)

Outputs a completed solution if solvable

Detects unsolvable puzzles gracefully

**Skills Demonstrated**

C++ algorithms and recursion

Backtracking search techniques

Debugging and edge case handling

Clean, modular code design

Future Improvements

GUI front-end for puzzle input and visualization

Option to generate Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty

Performance enhancements with heuristic solving strategies
